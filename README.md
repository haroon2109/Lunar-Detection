# üöÄ Lunar Surface Anomaly Detector: AI-Powered Analysis

**Unveiling the Moon's Secrets: A Novel Algorithm for Detecting Landslides, Boulders, and Craters with AI Insights.**

---

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project presents a cutting-edge web application demonstrating a novel algorithm designed to autonomously detect and quantify critical surface features on the Moon. Leveraging high-resolution imagery from India's **Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 missions**, our system aims to enhance future lunar mission safety, optimize landing site selection, and deepen our scientific understanding of lunar geological processes.

The application serves as an interactive showcase of our multi-stage detection workflow, augmented with powerful **AI-powered insights** to interpret findings and assess their implications.

## üí° Key Features

Our solution combines advanced image processing with intelligent AI capabilities for comprehensive lunar surface analysis:

### üõ∞Ô∏è Novel Detection Algorithm Workflow
Explore our robust, step-by-step algorithm:
1.  **Input Data:** Utilizes Chandrayaan-1/2 Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC), derived Digital Terrain Models (DTM), and Optical High Resolution Camera (OHRC) imagery.
2.  **Pre-processing & Normalization:** Radiometric, geometric corrections, and DTM generation.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** Derives topographic (slope, curvature) and textural (GLCM) characteristics.
4.  **Detection Modules (Hybrid Deep Learning Core):**
    * **Landslide Detection:** Employs a Random Forest Classifier for precise delineation.
    * **Boulder Detection:** Uses High-Resolution Image Processing with adaptive thresholding and enhanced edge detection.
5.  **Quantification & Metadata Output:** Provides precise measurements:
    * **Landslides:** Length, width, area, and estimated volume (where possible), along with latitude and longitude.
    * **Boulders:** Diameter, radius, estimated height, approximate volume, and latitude/longitude.
    * **Craters:** Detected and marked for comprehensive hazard mapping.
6.  **Output & Active Region Identification:** Generates graphical maps with marked features, detailed inventories, and identifies active geological regions.

### üß† AI-Powered Insights (Gemini API Integration)
Our application integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Google Gemini API to provide intelligent, contextual information:
* **Geological Insight:** Get AI-generated interpretations and implications of simulated detection results.
* **Feature Description Generator:** Automatically generate descriptive text for summarized detection findings.
* **Mission Impact Assessor:** Evaluate potential challenges and opportunities for hypothetical lunar missions based on detected features.
* **Algorithm Step Explainer:** Get concise explanations for complex algorithm concepts on demand.

### üñºÔ∏è Interactive Simulated Detection Visual
Upload your own lunar images and witness a live, simulated detection process directly within the browser! Our Canvas-based visualization will **mark landslides with green rectangles, boulders with green squares, and craters with yellow circles**, providing a dynamic demonstration of our algorithm's capabilities.
